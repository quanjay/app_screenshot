But while she was familiar with landscape design, she had never grown anything. A dedicated reader with a lifelong passion for literature, Marron turned to the library of gardening books she\u2019d collected to glean advice from a variety of writers on gardening and horticultural topics both grand and small.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMarron\u2019s quest to become a gardener, however, was about more than learning the basics about mulch or which plants work best in the shade. She sought something far more elusive: to identify the core qualities and characteristics that make a person a gardener and an understanding of what a garden could mean to her as it had to multitudes of other gardeners over the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn Becoming a Gardener, Catie Marron chronicles her transformation into a gardener over the course of eighteen months, seeding the details of her experience with rich advice from writers as diverse as Eleanor Per\u00e9nyi and Karel Capek, Penelope Lively, and Jamaica Kincaid. As she digs deeper into her readings and works in the garden itself, Marron not only discovers the essence of gardening but in the words of Michael Pollan, \u201cthe endlessly engrossing ways that cultivating a garden attaches a body to the earth.\u201d\r\n\r\nA delightful blend of informed opinion, personal reflection, and practical advice, Becoming a Gardener explores topics as varied as the composition of dirt, the agricultural wisdom of avid kitchen gardeners George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the healing power of digging in the soil, and the beauty of finding solitude in nature. Throughout, Marron carefully plants special illustrated features, such as musings on the merits (and detriments) of the rose, essential tools, moonlight gardening, children\u2019s books which feature gardens, and her favorite gardens around the world. Also included is an annotated list of recommended writers, books, and films related to gardens and gardening, and a monthly to-do calendar.\r\n\r\nBecoming a Gardener\u00a0is a very special and moving portrait of life and the enduring power of literature and nature that is sure to become an instant classic.\r\n\r\nSupplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780063139244.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobo

Dark humor. Deadly consequences\u2026 Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn\u2019t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly\u00a0not\u00a0Asian American\u2014in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestselling author of Babel.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAuthors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena\u2019s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.\r\n\r\nSo when June witnesses Athena\u2019s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena\u2019s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.\r\n\r\nSo what if June edits Athena\u2019s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song\u2014complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn\u2019t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That\u2019s what June claims, and the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0bestseller list seems to agree.\r\n\r\nBut June can\u2019t get away from Athena\u2019s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June\u2019s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.\r\n\r\nWith its totally immersive first-person voice,\u00a0Yellowface\u00a0grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang\u2019s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.\u00a0","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780063250864.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780063250864.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"05\/2023","publicationDateLong":"May 16, 2023","publicationDate":"2023-05-16","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_5_chime\/9780063250864.mp3?Expires=1747622606&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=83eDsh6QSGVxBDu-YAogQ_P1BRY=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"22","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"BIPOC Stories & Voices","action":"booklist\/category\/1200037","categoryId":1200037},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Literary Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200045","categoryId":1200045},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Comedy, Satire & Pa

Her mother's dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called \"calorie restriction,\" eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, \"Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn't tint hers?\" She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.\r\n \r\nIn I'm Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail\u2014just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (\"Hi Gale!\"), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships.

When Xishi draws the attention of the famous young military advisor Fanli, he presents her with a rare opportunity: to use her beauty as a weapon. One that could topple the rival neighbouring kingdom, improve the lives of her people and avenge her sister's murder. All she has to do is infiltrate the enemy palace as a spy and seduce their immoral king.\r\n\r\nWhat neither Xishi nor Fanli expect is the doomed attraction that ignites between them. Even worse, Xishi soon finds herself under the hungry gaze of the king and his advisors. Despite his gentleness, a brutality lurks and Xishi knows she can never let her guard down.

The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It\u2019s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.\r\n\r\nBut perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride\u2019s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast. \r\n\r\nAnd then someone turns up dead. Who didn\u2019t wish the happy couple well?

Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an account of the history of the human race.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781483086866.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781483086866.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4,"narratorRating":5,"publicationDateShort":"01\/2014","publicationDateLong":"January 28, 2014","publicationDate":"2014-01-28","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_chime\/9781483086866.mp3?Expire

Now, the commanding general\u2014also known as her tough-as-talons mother\u2014has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.\r\n\r\nBut when you\u2019re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away \u2026 because dragons don\u2019t bond to \u201cfragile\u201d humans. They incinerate them.\r\n\r\nWith fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother\u2019s daughter\u2014like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.\r\n\r\nYet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom\u2019s protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.\r\n\r\nFriends, enemies, lovers.

Her mother's dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called \"calorie restriction,\" eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, \"Your eyelashes are invisible, okay?

Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (\"Hi Gale!\"), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships.

''F**k positivity,'' Mark Manson says. ''Let\u2019s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.'' In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn\u2019t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is\u2014a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let\u2019s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected\u00a0modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.\r\n\r\nManson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited\u2014''not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.'' Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.\r\n\r\nThere are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-loo

05-18 02:43:26.310 24259 24585 I okhttp.OkHttpClient: t, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America - the first African American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the United States and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. \r\n\r\n In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her -- from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it -- in her own words and on her own terms.\r\n\r\n Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations -- and whose story inspires us to do the same.\r\n\r\n'A genuine page-turner, full of intimacies and reflections' Evening Standard\r\n\r\n'A rich, entertaining and candid memoir.

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life-until the unthinkable happens.\r\n\r\nWhere the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780525640370.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780525640370.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"08\/2018","publicationDateLong":"August 14, 2018","publicationDate":"2018-08-14","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_5_chime\/9780525640370.mp3?Expires=1747622607&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=4tFqDDYAR7AJGa2aqY0gd9DiUvo=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"572","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Contemporary Women","action":"booklist\/category\/1200035","categoryId":1200035},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Coming of Age","action":"booklist\/category\/1200036","categoryId":1200036},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Literary Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200045","categoryId":1200045},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Celebrity Bookclub Picks","action":"booklist\/category\/1200121","categoryId":1200121},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Favorite Movie Adaptations","action":"booklist\/category\/1200136","categoryId":1200136},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Fiction"

I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life's challenges-how to get relative with the inevitable-you can enjoy a state of success I call \"catching greenlights.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality.

When the animals at Manor Farm revolt against their master, Mr. Jones, their goal is to take over the farm and establish an ideal community based on hard work, honesty, and the equality of all animals. Guided by the memory of Old Major's utopian vision and the seven commandments, Animal Farm, as the animals have renamed it, briefly fulfills the ideal. Memories are short, however, and soon-through manipulation and aggression by those who assume power-the farm's founding principles are slowly eroded and abolished. Decades after its debut, Anima

Raised in the same household and sharing the same wet nurse, Amir and Hassan grow up in different worlds: Amir is the son of a prominent and wealthy man, while Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant, is a Hazara -- a shunned ethnic minority. Their intertwined lives, and their fates, reflect the eventual tragedy of the world around them. When Amir and his father flee the country for a new life in California, Amir thinks that he has escaped his past. And yet he cannot leave the memory of Hassan behind him.\r\n\r\nThe Kite Runner is a novel about friendship and betrayal, and about the price of loyalty. It is about the bonds between fathers and sons, and the power of fathers over sons -- their love, their sacrifices, and their lies. Written against a backdrop of history that has not been told in fiction before, The Kite Runner describes the rich culture and beauty of a land in the process of being destroyed. But through the devastation, Khaled Hosseini offers hope: through the novel's faith in the power of reading and storytelling, and in the possibilities he shows us for redemption.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780743567435.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780743567435.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"06\/2003","publicationDateLong":"June 01, 2003","publicationDate":"2003-06-01","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_chime\/9780743567435.mp3?Expires=1747622607&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=clKNydEEsCCak6dx1YLoPE6B7B8=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"alternateAbridgement":{"bookId":"34513","abridged":1,"duration":22740,"durationReadable":"06:19:00","abridgedNarrator":"Khaled Hossei

An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood-where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him.\r\n\r\nIn Colson Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. \r\n\r\nAs Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage-and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.\r\n\r\nLook for Colson Whitehead's new novel, Crook Manifesto!","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781524736262.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781524736262.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"08\/2016","publicationDateLong":"August 02, 2016","publicationDate":"2016-08-02","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_10_chime\/9781524736262.mp3?Expires=1747622607&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=1XEenFxHfbAaHLdXgnhkVMEnXIM=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"26","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Historical","action":"booklist\/category\/1200034","categoryId":1200034},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Literary Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200045","categoryId":1200045},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200032","categoryId":1200032},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Literature","action":"booklist\/category\/1200041","categoryId":1200041}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#bf5948"},"0015":{"sampleActualDuration":604,"cost":"$18.00 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"151","numNarratorRatings":"25","familyId":"743583763","bookId":"157622","abridged":"0","duration":20936,"durationReadable":"05:48:56","language":"","synccastMediaName":"9780739355961","isComingSoon":false,"badgeId":0,"title":"Speak: 20th Anniversary Edition","author":"Laurie Halse Anderson","isSelectsBook":false,"bookGroupIds":["5","30"],"friendlyUrl":"http:\/\/api.audiobooks.com\/audiobook\/speak-20th-anniversary-edition\/157622","productCategoryIds":[],"preventFreeTrialCredits":0,"canGetWithCredit":true,"authorArray":["Laurie Halse Anderson"],"authors":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"10234","name":"Laurie Halse Anderson","action":"booklist\/category\/6010234"}},"authorLinks":["booklist\/category\/6010234"],"narrator":"Ashley C.

She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. \r\n\r\nOnly her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. \r\n\r\nA timeless novel about consent and finding the courage to speak up for yourself, the twentieth anniversary edition of the classic novel that has spoken to so many young adults now includes a new introduction written and read by acclaimed writer, host, speaker, and cultural commentator Ashley C. Ford as well as an afterword written and read by New York Times-bestselling author of All American Boys and Long Way Down, Jason Reynolds.

One question. What is a woman for?\r\n\r\n In a small Oregon fishing town, five very different women navigate these new barriers alongside age-old questions surrounding motherhood, identity, and freedom. Ro, a single high-school teacher, is trying to have a baby on her own, while also writing a biography of Eivv?r, a little-known 19th-century female polar explorer. \r\n\r\n Susan is a frustrated mother of two, trapped in a crumbling marriage.  Mattie is the adopted daughter of doting parents and one of Ro's best students, who finds herself pregnant with nowhere to turn. And Gin is the gifted, forest-dwelling herbalist, or 'mender,' who brings all their fates together when she's arrested and put on trial in a frenzied modern-day witch hunt. \r\n\r\nRed Clocks is at once a riveting drama, whose mysteries unfold with magnetic energy, and a shattering novel of ideas. In the vein of Margaret Atwood and Eileen Myles, Leni Zumas fearlessly explores the contours of female experience, evoking The Handmaid's Tale for a new millennium.

We see them leave Bogot\u00e1 with their firstborn, Karina, in pursuit of safety and opportunity in the United States on a temporary visa, and we see the births of two more children, Nando and Talia, on American soil. We witness the decisions and indecisions that lead to Mauro's deportation and the family's splintering\u2014the costs they've all been living with ever since.\r\n \r\nAward-winning, internationally acclaimed author Patricia Engel, herself a dual citizen and the daughter of Colombian immigrants, gives voice to all five family members as they navigate the particulars of their respective circumstances. Rich with Bogot\u00e1 urban life, steeped in Andean myth, and tense with the daily reality of the undocumented in America, Infinite Country \"is as much an all-American story as it is a global one\" (Booklist, starred review).","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781797119595.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781797119595.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"03\/2021","publicationDateLong":"March 02, 2021","publicationDate":"2021-03-02","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FR

He worked the desert along the Mexican border, at the remote crossroads of drug routes and smuggling corridors, tracking humans through blistering days and frigid nights across a vast terrain. \r\n\r\nHe detains the exhausted and the parched. He hauls in the dead. He tries not to think where the stories go from there.\r\n\r\nHe is descended from Mexican immigrants, so the border is in his blood. But the line he is sworn to defend is dissolving. Haunted by nightmares, he abandons the Patrol for civilian life. And when an immigrant friend is caught on the wrong side of the border, Cant\u00fa faces a final confrontation with a world he believed he had escaped.\r\n\r\nThe Line Becomes a River is timely and electrifying. It brings to life this landscape of sprawling borderlands and the countless people who risk their lives to cross it. Yet it takes us beyond one person\u2019s experience to reveal truths about life on either side of an arbitrary line, wherever it is.\r\n\r\n'Stunningly good.

As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place.

This combination of slave memoir, fantasy, and historical fiction is a novel of rich literary complexity. Having just celebrated her 26th birthday in 1976 California, Dana, an African-American woman, is suddenly and inexplicably wrenched through time into antebellum Maryland. After saving a drowning white boy there, she finds herself staring into the barrel of a shotgun and is transported back to the present just in time to save her life. During numerous such time-defying episodes with the same young man, she realizes the challenge she's been given: to protect this young slaveholder until he can father her own great-grandmother. Author Octavia E. Butler skillfully juxtaposes the serious issues of slavery, human rights, and racial prejudice with an exciting science fiction, romance, and historical adventure. Kim Staunton's narrative talent magically transforms the listener's earphones into an audio time machine.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781436116961.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781436116961.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"05\/2008","publicationDateLong":"May 02, 2008","publicationDate":"2008-05-02","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_chime\/9781436116961.mp3?Expires=1747622607&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=XQJTlIxTsTRU9lazUjQh2ghY8L8=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"53","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"BIPOC Stories & Voices","action":"booklist\/category\/1200037","categoryId":1200037},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Social Science","action":"booklist\/category\/1200086","categoryId":1200086},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200032","categoryId":1200032},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Non-Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200084","categoryId":1200084}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#a74741"},"0007":{"sampleActualDuration":304,"cost":"$27.99 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"65","numNarratorRatings":"8","familyId":"743822070","bookId":"404102","abridged":"0","duration":39284,"durationReadable":"10:54:44","language":"","synccastMediaName":"9781488208386","isComingSoon":false,"badgeId":0,"title":"The Secret of You and Me","author":"Melissa Lenhardt","isSelectsBook":false,"bookGroupIds":["1","18"],"friendlyUrl":"http:\/\/api.audiobooks.com\/audiobook\/the-secret-of-you-and-me\/404102","productCategoryIds":[],"preventFreeTrialCredits":0,"canGetWithCredit":true,"authorArray":["Melissa Lenhardt"],"authors":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"176274","name":"Melissa Lenhardt","action":"booklist\/category\/6176274"}},"authorLinks":["booklist\/category\/6176274"],"narrator":"Natalie Duke","narratorArray":["Natalie Duke","Courtney Patterson"],"narratorLinks":["booklist\/category\/7171796","booklist\/category\/7037587"],"narrators":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"171796","name":"Natalie Duke","action":"booklist\/category\/7171796"},"0002":{"uniqueId":"37587","name":"Courtney Patterson","action":"booklist\/category\/7037587"}},"synopsis":"A DVF Book Club Pick!  \r\n\r\nTrue love never fades-and old secrets never die\u2026\r\n\r\nNora hasn't looked back.

05-18 02:43:26.320 24259 24586 I okhttp.OkHttpClient: \nThis unforgettable memoir from a prize-winning poet about growing up undocumented in the United States recounts the sorrows and joys of a family torn apart by draconian policies and chronicles one young man\u2019s attempt to build a future in a nation that denies his existence.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not a ghost even though an entire country was scared of you. No one in this story was a ghost. This was not a story.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Marcelo Hernandez Castillo was five years old and his family was preparing to cross the border between Mexico and the United States, he suffered temporary, stress-induced blindness. Castillo regained his vision, but quickly understood that he had to move into a threshold of invisibility before settling in California with his parents and siblings. Thus began a new life of hiding in plain sight and of paying extraordinarily careful attention at all times for fear of being truly seen. Before Castillo was one of the most celebrated poets of a generation, he was a boy who perfected his English in the hopes that he might never seem extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWith beauty, grace, and honesty, Castillo recounts his and his family\u2019s encounters with a system that treats them as criminals for seeking safe, ordinary lives. He writes of the Sunday afternoon when he opened the door to an ICE officer who had one hand on his holster, of the hours he spent making a fake social security card so that he could work to support his family, of his father\u2019s deportation and the decade that he spent waiting to return to his wife and children only to be denied reentry, and of his mother\u2019s heartbreaking decision to leave her children and grandchildren so that she could be reunited with her estranged husband and retire from a life of hard labor.\r\n\r\nChildren of the Land\u00a0distills the trauma of displacement, illuminates the human lives behind the headlines and serves as a stunning meditation on what it means to be a man and a citizen.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780062989413.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780062989413.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":3,"publicationDateShort":"01\/2020","publicationDateLong":"January 28, 2020","publicationDate":"2020-01-28","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_5_chime\/9780062989413.mp3?Expires=1747622607&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=lUSLvudtcZjAhTWO4ahTQ1uU9v8=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":0,"tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"History & Culture","action":"booklist\/category\/1200024","categoryId":1200024},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200025","categoryId":1200025},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"The Americas","action":"booklist\/category\/1200078","categoryId":1200078},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Biography & Memoir","action":"booklist\/category\/1200022","categoryId":1200022},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"History","action":"booklist\/category\/1200075","categoryId":1200075}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#779592"},"0010":{"sampleActualDuration":304,"cost":"$24.99 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"24","numNarratorRatings":"8","familyId":"743813545","bookId":"395583","abridged":"0","duration":30246,"durationReadable":"08:24:06","language":"","synccastMediaName":"9780063003910","isComingSoon":false,"badgeId":0,"title":"Felix Ever After","author":"Kacen Callender","isSelectsBook":false,"bookGroupIds":["1","23"],"friendlyUrl":"http:\/\/api.audiobooks.com\/audiobook\/felix-ever-after\/395583","productCategoryIds":[],"preventFreeTrialCredits":0,"canGetWithCredit":true,"authorArray":["Kacen Callender"],"authors":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"186747","name":"Kacen Callender","action":"booklist\/categ

Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.\r\n\r\nThere are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780062562982.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780062562982.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"09\/2016","publicationDateLong":"September 13, 2016","publicationDate":"2016-09-13","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_5_chime\/9780062562982.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=vPZuAzUz1g2uhCeXqrZ8Rc_dQhQ=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"417","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Blended","tag":"Self-Development","action":"booklist\/category\/1200138","categoryId":1200138},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Books with Buzz","action":"booklist\/category\/1200003","categoryId":1200003},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Better in Audio","action":"booklist\/category\/1200124","categoryId":1200124},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"For Podcast Lovers","action":"booklist\/category\/1200127","categoryId":1200127}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#d55222"},"0008":{"sampleActualDuration":604,"cost":"$20.00 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"3549","numNarratorRatings":"903","familyId":"743845436","bookId":"427439","abridged":"0","duration":24696,"durationReadable":"06:51:36","language":"","synccastMediaName":"9780593294185","isComingSoon":false,"badgeId":0,"title":"Greenlights","author":"Matthew McConaughey","isSelectsBook":false,"bookGroupIds":["5","30"],"friendlyUrl":"http:\/\/api.audiobooks.com\/audiobook\/greenlights\/427439","productCategoryIds":[],"preventFreeTrialCredits":0,"canGetWithCredit":true,"authorArray":["Matthew McConaughey"],"authors":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"239903","name":"Matthew McConaughey","action":"booklist\/category\/6239903"}},"authorLinks":["booklist\/category\/6239903"],"narrator":"Matthew McConaughey","narratorArray":["Matthew McConaughey"],"narratorLinks":["booklist\/category\/7239903"],"narrators":{"0001":{"uniqueId":"239903","name":"Matthew McConaughey","action":"booklist\/category\/7239903"}},"synopsis":"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 6 MILLION COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE!

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRecently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life's challenges-how to get relative with the inevitable-you can enjoy a state of success I call \"catching greenlights.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops.\r\n\u00a0\r\nHopefully, it's medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot's license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt's a love letter. To life.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt's also a guide to catching more greenlights-and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGood luck.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780593294185.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780593294185.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":5,"publicationDateShort":"10\/2020","publicationDateLong":"October 20, 2020","publicationDate":"2020-10-20","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_10_chime\/9780593294185.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=WZ9kboQzpSSenn7tS3_F7Xxatmg=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"294","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Arts & Entertainment","action":"booklist\/category\/1200023","categoryId":1200023},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Mindfulness & Meditation","action":"booklist\/category\/1200060","categoryId":1200060},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Celebrity Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200135","categoryId":1200135},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Biography & Memoir","action":"booklist\/category\/1200022","categoryId":1200022},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Health & Wellness","action":"booklist\/category\/1200058","categoryId":1200058},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Blended","tag":"Self-Development","action":"booklist\/category\/1200138","categoryId":1200138},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Books with Buzz","action":"booklist\/category\/1200003","categoryId":1200003},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"In TV & Film","action":"booklist\/category\/1200133","categoryId":1200133}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#fcfcfc"},"0009":{"sampleActualDuration":184,"cost":"$18.99 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"1995","numNarratorRatings":"215","familyId":"743540082","bookId":"92687","abridged":"0","duration":19800,"durationReadable":"05:30:00","language":"","synccastMediaName":"9781609419714","isComi

Her mother's dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called \"calorie restriction,\" eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, \"Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn't tint hers?\" She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.\r\n \r\nIn I'm Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail\u2014just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (\"Hi Gale!\"), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.\r\n \r\nTold with refreshing candor and dark humor, I'm Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781797147949.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781797147949.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":5,"publicationDateShort":"08\/2022","publicationDateLong":"August 09, 2022","publicationDate":"2022-08-09","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_chime\/9781797147949.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=iNthxJbPllzm77F1oThGtyvJwm4=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"311","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Arts & Entertainment","action":"booklist\/category\/1200023","categoryId":1200023},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200025","categoryId":1200025},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Relationships & Intimacy","action":"booklist\/category\/1200063","categoryId":1200063},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Celebrity Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200135","categoryId":1200135},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Biography & Memoir","action":"booklist\/category\/1200022","categoryId":1200022},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Health & Wellness","action":"booklist\/category\/1200058","categoryId":1200058},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Books with Buzz","action":"booklist\/category\/1200003","catego

Vance's powerful origin story...\r\n\r\nFrom a former marine and Yale Law School graduate now serving as a U.S. Senator from Ohio and the Republican Vice Presidential candidate for the 2024 election, an incisive account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class.\r\n\r\nTHE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\r\n\r\n''You will not read a more important book about America this year.''\u2014The Economist\r\n\r\n''A riveting book.''\u2014The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n''Essential reading.''\u2014David Brooks, New York Times\r\n\r\nHillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis\u2014that of white working-class Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.\r\n\r\nThe Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were ''dirt poor and in love,'' and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.\r\n\r\nA deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780062477521.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780062477521.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"06\/2016","publicationDateLong":"June 28, 2016","publicationDate":"2016-06-28","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_5_chime\/9780062477521.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=yorAQ1do4ZjGErek6glSXGaOTW0=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"

When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family. \r\n \r\nThe Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered. \r\n \r\nThe Glass Castle is truly astonishing\u2014a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family. \r\n \r\nThe memoir was also made into a major motion picture from Lionsgate in 2017 starring Brie Larson, Woody Harrelson, and Naomi Watts.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9781442339712.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9781442339712.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"09\/2010","publicationDateLong":"September 15, 2010","publicationDate":"2010-09-15","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_chime\/9781442339712.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=DjRr5EmXrQ57JuIDYy1skyE_EDo=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"61","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Biography & Memoir","action":"booklist\/category\/1200022","categoryId":1200022},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200025","categoryId":1200025},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Women","action":"booklist\/category\/1200029","categoryId":1200029}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#b6c7cd"},"0015":{"sampleActualDuration":604,"cost":"$25.00 (USD)","articles":"","isRead":false,"numRatings":"889","numNarratorRatings":"111","familyId":"7439192

Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world's foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In\u00a0The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers' capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments-from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga-that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists,\u00a0The Body Keeps the Score\u00a0exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal-and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.\r\n\r\nCover image: \u00a9 2020 Succession H.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a na\u00efve medical student \"possessed,\" as he wrote, \"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.\r\n\r\nWhat makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.\r\n\r\nPaul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\" he wrote. \"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.\r\n\r\nFinalist for the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Creative Nonfiction and the Books for a Better Life Award in Inspirational Memoir","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780399566172.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780399566172.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4.5,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"01\/2016","publicationDateLong":"January 12, 2016","publicationDate":"2016-01-12","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_10_chime\/9780399566172.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=erRlRybMlKiMjiF7mQV7_jZPQac=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"50","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Memoirs","action":"booklist\/category\/1200025","categoryId":1200025},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Social Science","action":"booklist\/category\/1200086","categoryId":1200086},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Blended","tag":"Lessons in Philosophy","action":"booklist\/category\/1200150","categoryId":1200150},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genr

It is phenomenal.\"-Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love\r\n\r\nA BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: Oprah Daily, The Washington Post, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Bloomberg, Parade \r\n\r\nThis is how you find yourself.\r\n\r\nThere is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasn't it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontent-even from ourselves.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voice-the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the world's expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living.\r\n\r\nSoulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our tr

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune's Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.\r\n\r\nA Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective-the story of one man's bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of \"hope and change,\" and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.\r\n\r\nThis beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama's conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.","coverUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/full\/9780525633723.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/covers.audiobooks.com\/images\/covers\/large\/9780525633723.jpg","hasOwnCover":true,"rating":4,"narratorRating":4.5,"publicationDateShort":"11\/2020","publicationDateLong":"November 17, 2020","publicationDate":"2020-11-17","mediaUrl":"https:\/\/abc-downloads.audiobooks.com\/FREEDL_10_chime\/9780525633723.mp3?Expires=1747622638&KeyName=abc-ardioberks-key&Signature=j4ksQpTanICfkdGkxjloyeV7oac=","isSaved":0,"isPurchased":0,"downloadUrl":"","lastPlayed":0,"isActiveUnlimited":0,"isPreordered":0,"isFreeBook":0,"seriesInformation":[],"numberOfReviews":"92","tags":[{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Law & Politics","action":"booklist\/category\/1200030","categoryId":1200030},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"The Americas","action":"booklist\/category\/1200078","categoryId":1200078},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Current Affairs, Law, & Politics","action":"booklist\/category\/1200085","categoryId":1200085},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Recent Award Winners","action":"booklist\/category\/1200118","categoryId":1200118},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Audie-Award Winners","action":"booklist\/category\/1200130","categoryId":1200130},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Biography & Memoir","action":"booklist\/category\/1200022","categoryId":1200022},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"History","action":"booklist\/category\/1200075","categoryId":1200075},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Genre","tag":"Non-Fiction","action":"booklist\/category\/1200084","categoryId":1200084},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Books with Buzz","action":"booklist\/category\/1200003","categoryId":1200003},{"background":"#E75200","type":"Booklist","tag":"Better in Audio","action":"booklist\/category\/1200124","categoryId":1200124}],"iconBackgroundColor":"#818181"}}},"messages":[]}
